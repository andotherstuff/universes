## Performance Impact

### Network Requests Reduced
- **Author queries**: From N individual requests to 1 batched request per component
- **Message queries**: Combined kinds [1, 9411] into single query
- **Community member queries**: Combined membership + activity into single query
- **DM queries**: Combined sent/received into single query

### Cache Efficiency Improved
- **Profile data**: 15-minute staleTime vs previous 1-minute default
- **Community data**: 30-minute staleTime vs previous 5-minute
- **Message data**: 45-second staleTime with 20-second refetch vs 30s/10s
- **Event cache**: Centralized storage with smart invalidation

### Component Performance Enhanced
- **MemberList**: Batched author queries eliminate N+1 query problem
- **MessageList**: Batched author queries for all message authors
- **Reduced re-renders**: Components only re-render when batched data changes

### Real-time Balance Maintained
- **Critical data**: Messages still refetch every 20 seconds
- **User activity**: Notifications check every 2 minutes
- **Static data**: Profiles and communities cached much longer

## Notes

- All optimizations should maintain backward compatibility
- Performance improvements should be measured and validated
- Consider relay capacity and rate limiting in optimization strategies
- Balance between performance and real-time updates based on use case
