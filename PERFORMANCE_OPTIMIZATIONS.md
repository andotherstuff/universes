- Batched query management with size limits

**Expected Impact:** 30-50% reduction in total queries

### 3. Enhanced Author Batching (`src/hooks/useAuthorBatch.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Checks individual author cache before batching
- Uses query deduplication for batch requests
- Caches individual authors for future use
- Reduced timeout from 3000ms to 2000ms
- Improved placeholder data handling

**Expected Impact:** 50-70% improvement in author query performance

### 4. Optimized Individual Author Queries (`src/hooks/useAuthor.ts`)

**Enhancements:**
- Integrates with deduplication system
- Caches empty results to prevent repeated failed queries
- Uses placeholder data from cache
- Reduced retry attempts

**Expected Impact:** 60-80% improvement in individual author lookups

### 5. Smart Message Caching (`src/hooks/useMessages.ts`)

**Features:**
- Background refresh for cached data
- Reduced query timeout from 5000ms to 3000ms
- Improved cache utilization with fallback strategies
- Disabled automatic refetch intervals
- Enhanced placeholder data from multiple cache sources

**Expected Impact:** 40-60% improvement in message loading performance

### 6. Enhanced Event Batching (`src/hooks/useEventBatch.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Integrates with deduplication system
- Caches individual events for cross-query reuse
- Improved placeholder data handling
- Reduced timeout from 5000ms to 3000ms

**Expected Impact:** 30-50% improvement in event batch queries

### 7. Smart Prefetching System (`src/hooks/useSmartPrefetch.ts`)

**Features:**
- Intelligent prefetching of likely-needed data
- Author profile prefetching based on visible content
- Community message prefetching for user's communities
- Prioritized prefetching based on user roles
- Background prefetching with minimal relay impact

**Expected Impact:** 200-400% increase in background loads and preloads

### 8. Enhanced Background Loading (`src/hooks/useBackgroundLoader.ts`)

**Existing Features Enhanced:**
- Better integration with new caching systems
- Improved batch processing
- Smarter community prioritization
- Reduced relay load through deduplication

**Expected Impact:** 100-200% increase in background optimization effectiveness

### 9. Query Optimizer Component (`src/components/QueryOptimizer.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Automatic query default optimization based on patterns
- Background cleanup of stale queries
- Query deduplication at the React Query level
- Memory management for long-running sessions

**Expected Impact:** 20-30% overall performance improvement

### 10. Enhanced Performance Monitoring (`src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitor.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Better cache hit detection
- Separate timing for cached vs non-cached queries
- More accurate performance metrics
- Real-time performance classification

**Expected Impact:** Better visibility into optimization effectiveness

## Performance Targets

### Cache Hit Rate
- **Target:** 60-80% (up from 1%)
- **Strategy:** Aggressive caching, deduplication, prefetching

### Average Load Time
- **Target:** 800-1200ms (down from 3703ms)
- **Strategy:** Reduced timeouts, cached data serving, background updates

### Query Efficiency
- **Target:** 50-70% reduction in total queries
- **Strategy:** Deduplication, batching, smart caching

### Background Optimizations
- **Target:** 20-50 background loads per session
- **Target:** 10-30 preloads per session
- **Strategy:** Smart prefetching, background loading

## Implementation Details

### Cache Strategy
1. **Immediate Cache Serving:** Use `placeholderData` to show cached content instantly
2. **Background Updates:** Refresh data in background while showing cached content
3. **Intelligent Staleness:** Different stale times based on data volatility
4. **Memory Management:** Automatic cleanup of old queries

### Query Optimization
1. **Deduplication:** Prevent duplicate queries within time windows
2. **Batching:** Combine similar queries for efficiency
3. **Timeout Reduction:** Faster failure detection and retry
4. **Smart Retries:** Fewer retries with exponential backoff

### Prefetching Strategy
1. **User-Centric:** Prefetch based on user's communities and activity
2. **Priority-Based:** Owners/moderators get priority prefetching
3. **Adaptive:** Adjust prefetching based on user behavior
4. **Resource-Aware:** Limit concurrent prefetch operations

## Monitoring and Metrics

The performance dashboard now shows:
- Real-time cache hit rates
- Average load times (excluding cached queries)
- Background optimization counts
- Query efficiency metrics
- Performance rating (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent)

## Expected Results

With these optimizations, the application should achieve:

1. **Cache Hit Rate:** 60-80% (60x improvement)
2. **Average Load Time:** 800-1200ms (3x improvement)
3. **Total Queries:** 50-70% reduction
4. **Background Loads:** 20-50 per session
5. **Preloads:** 10-30 per session
6. **Overall Performance Rating:** Good to Excellent

## Usage

All optimizations are automatically enabled when the application starts. The performance dashboard is enabled by default to monitor improvements and can be hidden by clicking the X button.

The optimizations are designed to be:
- **Transparent:** No changes to existing component APIs
- **Adaptive:** Automatically adjust based on usage patterns
- **Resource-Conscious:** Minimize relay load and memory usage
- **User-Focused:** Prioritize user's most important data

## Future Enhancements

Potential additional optimizations:
1. Service Worker caching for offline support
2. IndexedDB for persistent local storage
3. WebSocket connections for real-time updates
4. CDN integration for static assets
5. Progressive loading for large datasets
