# AOS Universes — Dog‑Food MVP (DF MVP)

> Single‑relay dog‑food build to validate core community experience before broader release.

---

### Legend
- ✅ — Complete
- 🚧 - Under construction (in progress)
- 🙅‍♀️ - Yeah, nah...

---

## Scope & Constraints
- **Relay:** `universes.to` (single relay for DF)
- **URL:** DF app served at **`universes.social`**
- **Experimentation:** Live experimentation continues on `universes.to` (separate from DF app)
- **Out of scope:** Marketplace, Resources (excluded for DF MVP)

---

## Features

### 1) Performance & Reliability
- 🚧 Fast initial load and snappy navigation (TTI target on baseline devices)
- 🚧 Retry/backoff on relay hiccups; offline toasts with “Retry”
- 🚧 Error boundaries per page; preserve state on failure (no hard resets)
- 🚧 Client logs include error codes and relay responses (PII‑redactable)

### 2) Web Notifications
- ✅ Explicit opt‑in prompt with clear explanation
- 🚧 Respect OS **Do Not Disturb**

### 3) Universes, Channels & Content
**Universes:** Group spaces wtih channels where users can create and share content

**Channel types:** Text channels, Voice channels

**Moderator capabilities**
- 🚧 Invite new users to join a Universe with (1) single-use invite links and (2) multi-use invite links with a custom expiration
- ✅ Create / edit / delete channels (text & voice)
- ✅ Pin posts (automatically refreshes/updates)
- 🚧 Unpin posts (adding automatic refresh/update)

**User capabilities**
- ✅ Create posts; threaded replies; emoji reactions
- ✅ Zap posts
- ✅ Create & share events (date/time + link)
- ✅ Create & share polls (single/multi‑select; open/close time)
- ✅ Upload files (images/docs/audio) with previews
- ✅ Post links with previews

**DF Decisions**
- **File previews**
  - ✅ Images → inline thumbnail + lightbox
  - 🚧 Docs/PDF → file card (name, size, type) + “View / Download”
  - 🚧 Audio → compact inline player (duration)
- **Link previews**
  - 🚧 Basic unfurl (title/description/favicon/thumbnail) using server‑side fetch with caching
  - 🚧 Respect robots/no‑cache; user can collapse previews
- **Hashtags**
  - **Not included** in DF MVP; revisit after behavior is defined (search/subscriptions semantics)

### 4) Moderation
**Roles**
- 🚧 Owner(s) can grant/revoke **Mod** role (currently have to do this via Chorus; creating capability in Universes)
- ✅ All **Owners** are **Mods** for their Universe(s)

**Actions**
- ✅ **Boot user** (removes membership & posting rights)  
  Public‑read Universe: booted users may still read public content but cannot interact.  
  Private‑read Universe: booted users lose all visibility.
- 🚧 **Hide** vs **Delete** content  
  Hide → removes from member timelines; reversible; retained for audit.  
  Delete → removes where feasible; may leave tombstone.
  Needs to be more clearly explained to users
- ✅ **Report**: users can report posts/users with reason codes + notes
- 🚧 **Manage Reports**: mods can dismiss/hide unactioned reports (so they don't stack up endlessly)

### 5) Direct Messages (DMs)
- ✅ Auto‑select modern private DMs when supported (NIP‑17 family); fall back to legacy encrypted DMs (NIP‑04)
- 🚧 Clear message state (sent / delivered / failed) with retry
- 🚧 First‑use tooltip explains tradeoffs & metadata leakage considerations

### 6) Accessibility & UX
- 🚧 Keyboard navigable; visible focus states; motion‑reduced option
- 🚧 WCAG AA color contrast; light/dark/system modes (partially implemented, but messy)
- 🚧 Alt‑text requested on image uploads

### 7) Settings (Minimum)
- 🚧 Notifications (per‑event toggles)
- 🚧 Privacy (DM tooltips on/off)
- 🚧 Content (autoplay voice previews off by default)
- 🚧 Display (light/dark/system)
- 🚧 Data (clear cache)

### 8) Telemetry for DF
- 🚧 Anonymous counters: channel ops, posts, replies, reactions, zaps, file/link preview renders, DMs, mod actions, errors
- 🚧 Daily CSV export for DF review

---

## Non‑Goals (DF MVP)
- ✅ Marketplace
- ✅ Resources

## Definitions
- **Boot:** Remove user from Universe membership & posting rights. Public‑read Universes remain viewable; private‑read Universes become invisible.
- **Hide vs Delete:** Hide = reversible moderation action; Delete = removal where feasible (may show tombstone).

## Open Questions (post‑DF)
- Voice channels: speaker requests/raise‑hand, recording, or stage mode?
- Link unfurl privacy: per‑Universe toggle to disable server‑side fetch?
- Hashtags: should they map to Nostr `t` tags and power search/subscriptions?
- DM retention: per‑conversation retention windows (e.g., 24h ephemeral)?
- Notifications: Per‑event‑type toggles (mentions, DMs, thread replies, mod notices)?

## Success Signals
- Smooth performance/reliability; low error rates
- Healthy creation mix (posts, replies, zaps, polls/events)
- Clear, effective mod workflows (hide vs delete; boot semantics)
- DF telemetry shows daily use across core flows
